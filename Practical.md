### Getting started at the cognitive psychology unit
Ask secretary [Eva Potters](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/eva-potters#tab-1) to be added to the _FSW - Cogpsy_ mailing list. 

To add the associated calendar: in Outlook (doesn't work on the web version, unfortunately), click 'add shared calendar' and search for _FSW - Cogpsy_. Avoid the 'FSW - Cognitive psychology lab 2020', it's not in use. If you only see events as 'busy' or 'free' (without content), you can request access via [this link](https://helpdesk.universiteitleiden.nl/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=6b7c11114bbb43128ee08b9de64eddc8&openedFromService=true) after logging in with your UCLN account. _Update_: I haven't gotten this to work so far, let me know if you manage.

The _MS Teams_ group has a good wiki with a lot of department-related information. Make sure to check it out!

### Getting started in the lab
Ask Anne to add you to
1. lab Teams channel
2. lab calendar (Google calendar)

### Templates and documents
- [Weekly meeting notes](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/MeetingTemplate.html)
- [Mentoring agreement](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/MentoringAgreement.html)
- [Collaboration agreement](https://anne-urai.github.io/lab_wiki/CollaborationAgreement.html)

### Meetings
- Cognitive Psychology colloquia are held at 16.00 on Thursdays. Email [Julia Folz](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/medewerkers/julia-folz#tab-1) if you're interested in receiving weekly invitations.
- We meet once a month with a smaller group interested in computational modelling. Email [Selin Topel](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/selin-topel#tab-1) to get on the mailing list.
- The lab meets weekly; see lab calendar for times.
- I intend to have weekly meetings with PhD students and postdocs; for Master students, see the guidelines on BrightSpace.

#### Booking a room at Leiden Uni.
- lecture hall somewhere in the university: email the [ServiceDesk](https://www.medewerkers.universiteitleiden.nl/gebouwen-faciliteiten/gebouwen/zaal-reserveren?cf=sociale-wetenschappen&cd=psychologie) of every faculty separately (there is no uni-wide system).
- nice workshop space: [Lorentz Center](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/calendar.html). When there are no workshops, Leiden Uni staff can make use of the space.
- common room in PdlC building: in Outlook web calendar, simply create an event and select 'Psychology Common Room' as the location. 
- Olthoff room (CogPsy) for up to 8 ppl: there is a paper calendar at the secretariat.
 
### Conferences
I normally go to the Dutch [NVP](https://www.societyforbrainandcognition.nl/) (more cognitive) or [DNM](https://dnm22.azuleon.org/) (more neuro) meetings in person, and to the virtual NeuroMatch conferences. Depending on your career stage and interests, you can consider attending FENS, SfN, ECVP, ASSC, CCN.

I strongly encourage students and postdocs to attend at least one summer school. Neuromatch Academy is fantastic, as is the in-person [Rauischolzhausen vision science](http://www.allpsych.uni-giessen.de/rauisch/) one.

Feel free to explore meetings and conferences, and discuss where you'd like to go!

### Laptop
Once you get a university laptop (talk to Anne before ordering it, to make sure we get you something useful) request it to switch to ['semi-managed'](https://helpdesk.universiteitleiden.nl/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=2c19d2f22cde4c509ff4958b173a2fba). Without doing this, you won't be able to install much software. Ask Anne how to best do this.
