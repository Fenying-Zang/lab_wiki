title: Meeting template

---

For our weekly supervision meetings, we'll use the template below (feel free to adapt it to your needs, or give me feedback). It was adapted from [Tomas Knapen's lab wiki](https://github.com/tknapen/tknapen.github.io/wiki/Meeting-template), who in turn got it from Martin Hebart.

Fill it in before our meeting, and send it to Anne by email (just in the body of the text) with title _'Weekly summary [date]'_.

_Note: if you feel like skipping the meeting, that's totally fine. If it's for scientific reasons (just discovered a bug in my code, model is still running on the cluster) let me know. If it's for personal reasons, you of course don't have to tell me the specifics._
