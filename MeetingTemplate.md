# Weekly / regular meetings

For our regular supervision meetings, we'll use the template below (feel free to adapt it to your needs, or give me feedback). It was adapted from [Tomas Knapen's lab wiki](https://github.com/tknapen/tknapen.github.io/wiki/Meeting-template), who in turn got it from Martin Hebart.

Fill it in before our meeting, and send it to Anne by email (just in the body of the text) with title _'Weekly summary [date]'_.

_Note: if you feel like skipping the meeting, that's totally fine. If it's for scientific reasons (just discovered a bug in my code, model is still running on the cluster) let me know. If it's for personal reasons, you of course don't have to tell me the specifics._

### Current state of wellbeing
Motivation is pretty good / I'm demotivated because... / I have fun working on ... / Still trying to get over the paper rejection... / I'm struggling with ... / I'm bored / Insecure

### Past work
Describe the progress of the past week (or period since we last met), including longer descriptions (text, figures, code). Ideally, code + figures live in a shared GitHub repo or other document where I can browse them before we meet.

- Done, as planned
- Done, with some changes, due to ...
- Not done, since [insert problem]
- Something else came up

### Next steps
- These are the obvious next things I'll pursue
- I have a fantastic new idea for a new analysis that solves all our problems
- Based on our conversations, I want to try what you suggested 4 weeks ago but I never tried it...
- I'm stuck on ...

### What I need (from supervision) right now
_Feel free to already send me some keywords or action points ahead of time, so I can prepare better for our meeting._
- Analysis ideas / research / methods
- Writing feedback
- Reading suggestions, content knowledge
- Administrative help
- Academic language and culture
- Peptalk / well-being
- Career planning
- Not much; the meeting is just to share an update
- ...

### Action points
_During our meeting, write the action points that we discussed and make them the start of next meeting's template. Ideally, write those as we chat and send them as a reply email afterwards._

# Evaluation meetings
Once or twice a year, we'll zoom out together to see what's been done, what lies ahead, what works well and what doesn't.

For instance:
- Are you happy with the way things are going - scientifically, personally, in the department and in the lab?
- What have you accomplished? Does this match your original plans?
- What did you struggle with?
- What works well, and what can we improve, in our mentoring relationship and in our lab culture? 
- Do you have/need a constellation of different mentors to advise you on different goals/aspects of your life and career?
- What are your goals for the next few months or year? Where do you see yourself in a few years?

This [template from Yael Niv](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_RfH4f23_5n2cKxqoItRJBE8PrGkHfuO7w-6P701gr8/edit) is a great start for a mentoring agreement - complementary to your own development plan.
