title: Meeting template

---

For our weekly supervision meetings, we'll use the template below. It was adapted from [Tomas Knapen's lab wiki](https://github.com/tknapen/tknapen.github.io/wiki/Meeting-template).

Fill it in before our weekly meeting, and send it to Anne by email (just in the body of the text) with title 'Weekly summary [date]'.
_Note: if you feel like skipping our meeting, that's totally fine. If it's for scientific reasons (just discovered a bug in my code, model is still running on the cluster) let me know. If it's for personal reasons you could indicate this, but no need to let me know the details._
